### 🚀 Ready for Merging

Your monorepo is now structured to easily merge with another repository:

1. **Clean Package Structure**: Each component is in its own `packages/` directory
2. **Workspace Configuration**: Supports npm, pnpm, and lerna workspaces
3. **Unified Scripts**: Single commands to manage the entire project
4. **Docker Ready**: Full containerization support
5. **Development Ready**: One-click development environment setup

### 🔧 Key Features

- **Backend**: Your preferred Python FastAPI backend is preserved in `packages/backend/`
- **Frontend**: Next.js frontend ready for replacement with your preferred frontend
- **Shared Types**: Common interfaces and utilities in `packages/shared/`
- **ML Pipeline**: Machine learning components in `packages/ml/`
- **Scripts**: Windows batch scripts for easy development

### 📋 Next Steps for Merging

1. **Replace Frontend**: Copy your preferred frontend code to `packages/frontend/`
2. **Update Dependencies**: Modify `package.json` files as needed
3. **Configure APIs**: Update API endpoints in frontend to match backend
4. **Test Integration**: Run `scripts/dev.bat` to test the full stack
5. **Clean Up**: Run `scripts/cleanup.bat` to remove old directories

### 🛠️ Development Commands

```bash
# Start development environment
scripts\dev.bat

# Stop all services
scripts\stop.bat

# Build all packages
scripts\build.bat

# Clean up old directories
scripts\cleanup.bat

# Or use npm scripts
npm run dev          # Start all services
npm run build        # Build all packages
npm run test         # Test all packages
npm run docker:up    # Start with Docker
```

### 🎯 Benefits of This Structure

- **Modular**: Each package is independent and can be developed separately
- **Scalable**: Easy to add new packages or services
- **Maintainable**: Clear separation of concerns
- **Deployable**: Ready for containerized deployment
- **Team-Friendly**: Multiple developers can work on different packages

Your backend code is preserved exactly as you wanted it, and the structure is now ready for merging with your preferred frontend!
